**I will split this into 3 tiers based on importance.**

## Tier 1 (No skimping)
### 1. Chair

A good chair will last you ages and will keep your spine intact for the years to come. 
_But Dennis, you said it's a minimalistic desk setup for people on the go or students how can you expect us to 
spend a lot of money on a chair?_ 
I was a dumbass like you a year or two ago, the answer is your health deteriorates on a daily basis, if you destroy your back now you will not be able to spend any time in front of the computer in the future. 
Also if you buy a good chair it will retain most of its value so you can resell it or in the worst case scenrio move with it. 
- Herman Miller Aeron (GOAT) - **1000$** - great chair, super expensive
You can get a used one for 20% of the original price, I got mine for 200$ on gumtree.

- Ikea Markus - **179$** - good chair, honorable mention
This chair is decent, I have used it before but personally I'd rather spend the extra 20-30$ and get used Herman Miller.

### 2. Monitor
Another big one, you will be staring and glaring at this thing for ages, you have to make sure it's as crisp as possible so you do not strain your eyesight by constantly trying to focus on something blurry. I'd recommend going with at least 24 inches, I use currently a 27 inch monitor and for me animation smoothness is more important than higher resolution, I believe going to and over 4K at 27 inches does not really give a lot of benefit thus I went with 1440p monitor at 144hz and IPS (good color accuracy).  

I should add here that since I have a laptop I use laptop's screen as 2nd monitor but if I were on a PC I would look for a second monitor for side-tasks, second monitor greatly increases productivity.

## Tier 2 
### 3. Mouse
This one is up to you really, you can spend a lot and a little depending on the versitality you want from your mouse. Will you use it for anything else besides programming? if not then you can buy any cheap mouse that feels comfortable, if you are into gaming 
you would probably want to spend a bit more take a look into latency etc. 

### 4. Keyboard
Some savages swear by keyboards of the likes of apple with membranes and short key travel these people have clearly steered to far from God and are on a path of no return, just let them go and try to ignore their cry for help when they try to convince you to get one of their keyboards for yourself. I have switched a couple of years ago to mechanical keyboards and never looked back, my first mechanical keyboard was from razer - blackwidow - it was an OK keyboard nothing to write home about, it is like anything from razer shiny gamery trash that will break the day after the warranty expires. The next keyboard was corsair K65 - tenkeyless with cherry mx reds reasonably priced I would really recommend this keyboard. There seems to be more and more budget-friendly mechanical keyboards on the market. If you are looking currently for your first mechanical keyboard I'd recommend getting one of the testers first (you can get it cheap on alibaba or banggood) which will allow you to play with different mechanical switches so you can find the one that suits you the most. My latest keyboard Ducky One 2 mini is really good, it is too expensive for what it is though, it's a minimalistic 67 key cherry mx red board - it is really small really good to travel with and has a unpluggable cord (which is not as common as it should be).

### 5. Mouse mat
Buy a large mouse mat preferably one that will take the length of your desk, having something comfortable to put your hands on is always good and having single surface to put both of your hands on won't hurt either. If a mouse mat is good you will never have to think about it.

## Tier 3 (Optional | good to haves)
### 4. DJ stand _if you have a laptop_
This will help cool down your laptop as well as gives you adjustable height for your laptop monitor so you can have it in line with tour main monitor.
### 5. Portable speaker
If you prefer wearing headphones all day long then fair enough but when I get home I'd rather play music on speakers and let my head/ears rest a bit. The in-built audio speakers in laptops and monitors are terrible probably even worse than most smartphones thus investing into a speaker might be a good idea.
### 6. Wireless charger
I took a plunge and moved to the wireless world, both my headphones and smartphones can be charged wirelessely. For the phone I bought a receiver from alibaba for 3-5$ and I bought 2 chargers so one is next to my workspace at home and the other is next to my workspace at work, thus my devices never discharge I don't even have to think about it, since when I'm not using them, they are charging.
