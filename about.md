I'm a Software Developer III in a large company that sells scientific journals to different organisations (Univeristies, Governments etc.). This is a complementary blog to my Youtube channel where I can go more into detail about some topics as well as update information that went out of date in the video - software / book recommendations etc. 

This place is also a way for me to give my inner self a voice which on a daily basis is locked away to not be heard by my corporate 9-5 overlords.
